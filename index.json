anisotropy in ice alters the propagation of polarized radio waves, so polarimetric radar sounding can be used to survey anisotropic properties of ice masses. Ice anisotropy is either intrinsic, associated with ice-crystal orientation fabric (COF), or extrinsic, associated with material heterogeneity, such as bubbles, fractures, and directional roughness at the glacier bed. Anisotropy develops through a history of snow deposition and ice flow, and the consequent mechanical properties of anisotropy then feed back to influence ice flow. Constraints on anisotropy are therefore important for understanding ice dynamics, ice-sheet history, and future projections of ice flow and associated sea-level rise. Radar techniques, applied using ground-based, airborne, or spaceborne instruments, can be deployed more quickly and over a larger area than either direct sampling, via ice core drilling, or analogous seismic techniques. Here, we review the physical nature of dielectric anisotropy in glacier ice, the general theory for radio-wave propagation through anisotropic media, polarimetric radar instruments and survey strategies, and the extent of applications in glacier settings. We close by discussing future directions, such as polarimetric interpretations outside COF, planetary and astrophysical applications, innovative survey geometries and polarimetric profiling. We argue that the recent proliferation in polarimetric radar marks a critical inflection, since there are now several approaches for data collection and processing. This review aims to guide the expanding polarimetric user base to appropriate techniques so they can address new and existing challenges in glaciology, such as constraining ice viscosity, a critical control on ice flow and future sea-level rise.","tags":[],"title":"Radar Polarimetry in Glaciology: Theory, Measurement Techniques, and Scientific Applications for Investigating the Anisotropy of Ice Masses Greenland and Canadian Arctic ice temperature profiles database","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Hills","Nick Holschuh","Andrew Hoffman","Annika Horlings","Emma Erwin","TJ Fudge","Eric Steig","Knut Christianson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1725235200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1725235200,"objectID":"f5ab982773827b8b6591b5eee6a15af0","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/hills2024a/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hills2024a/","section":"publication","summary":"Hercules Dome is a prospective ice-core site due to its location in the bottleneck between East and West Antarctica. If ice from the last interglacial period has been preserved there, it could provide critical insight into the history of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The likelihood of a continuous, well-resolved, easily interpretable climate record preserved in ice extracted from Hercules Dome depends in part on the persistence of the divide dynamics. Significant changes in ice drawdown on either side of the divide, towards the Ross or Ronne ice shelves, could change the relative thickness of layers and the deposition environment represented in the core. Here, we use ice-penetrating radar to survey the ice dynamics at Hercules Dome. Repeated radar acquisitions show that vertical velocities are consistent with the Raymond Effect expected at an ice divide with a frozen bed. Polarimetric radar acquisitions capture the ice crystal orientation fabric (COF) which develops over time as a result of cumulative strain, so it depends on both the pattern of ice flow and the time over which that flow has been consistent. We use a physical model to simulate the timescales for COF evolution, finding that the summit of Hercules Dome has been dynamically stable in its current configuration, at least during deglaciation over the last nine thousand years. The evident stability may result from a prominent bedrock ridge under the divide, which had not been previously surveyed and was therefore not represented in the bed geometry of coarsely resolved ice-sheet models.","tags":[],"title":"Radar-derived crystal orientation fabric suggests dynamic stability at the summit of Hercules Dome during the last ice-sheet deglaciation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Hills","Matthew Siegfried","Dustin Schroeder"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1718150400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718150400,"objectID":"1fb8f0ec3ca559d3b9e4d0feb782f6ce","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/hills2024b/","publishdate":"2024-06-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hills2024b/","section":"publication","summary":"Subglacial lakes have been mapped across Antarctica with two methods, radio‐echo sounding (RES) and ice‐surface deformation. At sites where both are coincident, these methods typically provide conflicting interpretations about the ice‐bed interface. With a single exception, active subglacial lakes identifiedby surface deformation do not display the expected flat, bright, and specular bed reflection in RES data,characteristic of non‐active lakes. This observational conundrum suggests that our understanding of Antarctic subglacial hydrology, especially beneath important fast‐moving ice streams, remains incomplete. Here, we usean airborne RES campaign that surveyed a well‐characterized group of active subglacial lakes on lower Mercer and Whillans ice streams, West Antarctica, to explore inconsistency between the two observational techniques. We test hypotheses of increased scattering and attenuation due to the presence of an active subglacial lake system that could suppress reflected bed‐echo power for RES observations in these locations, finding that entrained water is most plausible.","tags":[],"title":"Entrained Water in Basal Ice Suppresses Radar Bed‐Echo Power at Active Subglacial Lakes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["TJ Fudge","Raphael Sauvage","Linh Vu","Benjamin Hills","Mirko Severi","Edwin Waddington"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1698883200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1698883200,"objectID":"6bb7d3e5366eba831c7ba708c2a549ed","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/fudge2023/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fudge2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Volcanic deposition of sulfuric acid in ice cores is important both for understanding past volcanic activity and for synchronizing ice core timescales.

Here, we use records of sulfate from the EPICA Dome C (EDC) ice core to estimate the effective diffusivity of sulfuric acid in ice. We focus on EDC because multiple glacial-interglacial cycles are preserved, allowing analysis for long timescales and deposition in similar climates. We calculate the mean concentration gradient and the width of prominent volcanic events, and analyze the evolution of each with depth/age. We find the effective diffusivities for interglacials and glacial maximums to be 5 ± 2 × 10-9 m2 a-1, an order of magnitude lower than a previous estimate derived from the Holocene portion of EDC (Barnes et al., 2003). The effective diffusivity may be even smaller if artificial diffusion from the sampling is accounted for. Effective diffusivity is not obviously affected by the ice temperature until about -10 °C, 3000 m depth, which is also where anomalous sulfate peaks begin to be observed (Traversi et al., 2009). Low effective diffusivity suggests that sulfuric acid is not readily diffusing in liquid-like veins in the upper portions of the Antarctic ice sheet and that records may be preserved in deep, old ice if the ice temperature remains well below the pressure melting point.","tags":[],"title":"Effective diffusivity of sulfuric acid in Antarctic ice cores","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrew Hoffman","Nick Holschuh","Megan Mueller","John Paden","Atsuhiro Muto","Gordon Ariho","Cassandra Brigham","John Christian","Lindsey Davidge","Emma Heitmann","Benjamin Hills","Annika Horlings","Susannah Morey","Gemma O'Connor","TJ Fudge","Eric Steig","Knut Christianson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1697068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1697068800,"objectID":"e73661496093ceaaa24cd1b2d7763fa4","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/hoffman2023/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hoffman2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Geology and bed topography influence how ice sheets respond to climate change. Despite the West Antarctic Ice Sheet’s capacity to retreat and advance quickly over its over-deepened interior, little is known about the subglacial landscape of the East Antarctic elevated interior that probably seeded West Antarctic ice streams and glaciers. At Hercules Dome, we use three-dimensional swath radar technology to image the upstream origin of large subglacial basins that drain ice from the Antarctic interior into West Antarctic ice streams. Radar imaging reveals an ancient, alpine landscape with hanging tributary valleys and large U-shaped valleys. On the valley floors, we image subglacial landforms that are typically associated with temperate basal conditions and fast ice flow. Formation mechanisms for these subglacial landforms are fundamentally inconsistent with the currently slowly flowing ice. Regional aerogravity shows that these valleys feed into larger subglacial basins that host thick sediment columns. Past tectonism probably created these basins and promoted ice flow from Hercules Dome into the Ross and Filchner–Ronne sectors. This suggests that the landscape at Hercules Dome was shaped by fast-flowing ice in the past when the area may have served as or been proximal to a nucleation centre for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.","tags":[],"title":"Scars of tectonic extension promote ice-sheet nucleation from Hercules Dome, West Antarctica","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anja Løkkegaard","and 26 others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1694131200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694131200,"objectID":"3fce195814de819cefa9c33e2155424f","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/lokkegaard2023/","publishdate":"2023-09-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lokkegaard2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Here, we present a compilation of 95 ice temperature profiles from 85 boreholes from the Greenland ice sheet and peripheral ice caps, as well as local ice caps in the Canadian Arctic.

Warm ice deforms more easily, establishing a positive feedback loop in an ice stream where fast flow leads to warm ice and then to even faster flow. Here, we use radar attenuation measurements to show that the Siple Coast ice streams are colder than previously thought due to along-flow advection of cold ice from upstream. We interpret the attenuation results within the context of previous ice-temperature measurements from nearby sites where hot-water boreholes were drilled. These in-situ temperatures are notably colder than model predictions, both in the ice streams and in an ice-stream shear margin. We then model ice temperature using a 1.5-dimensional numerical model which includes a parameterization for along-flow advection. Compared to analytical solutions, we find depth-averaged temperatures that are colder by 0.7°C in the Bindschadler Ice Stream, 2.7°C in the Kamb Ice Stream, and 6.2-8.2°C in the Dragon Shear Margin, closer to the borehole measurements at all locations. Modelled cooling corresponds to shear-margin thermal strengthening by 3-3.5 times compared to the warm-ice case, which must be compensated by some other weakening mechanism such as material damage or ice-crystal fabric anisotropy.","tags":[],"title":"Radar attenuation demonstrates advective cooling in the Siple Coast ice streams","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Hills"],"categories":["Fieldwork"],"content":"We typically think of ice cores in the context of global climate. For instance, Antarctic ice cores demonstrate the link between greenhouse gases and temperature, both through glacial cycles (e.g. Dome C) and into the human era (e.g. Law Dome). What many don’t know is that some of the most powerful ice-core interpretation has been for regional climate rather than global. Take Richard Alley’s interpretation of the Younger Dryas from a Greenland ice core, GISP2. Noticing substantial precipitation changes in Greenland over very short timescales (~decades), he argued for changes in both atmospheric and ocean circulation in the North Atlantic as the Earth was coming out of the last glacial period. Ultimately, these changes led to a global climate event in the Younger Dryas, but the critical measurement for this inference was local to the North Atlantic around Greenland.\nHere, we are focused on climate in the North Pacific and how that can be sampled using alpine ice cores from Southeast Alaska and, in this case specifically, coastal British Columbia. The North Pacific is dominated by two pressure systems, the Aleutian Low and the North Pacific High. Seattle-ites will be very familiar with the effects of these pressure systems. During winter, cold temperatures move the high pressure system to lower latitude and allow the Aleutian Low to grow which brings wet weather to Seattle and the broader Pacific Northwest. Alpine ice cores preserve the dynamics of this system and how it may have changed over the last ~few hundred years.\n  Atmospheric circulation in the North Pacific.  Mt. Waddington is the highest mountain in British Columbia. As may be expected for such a prominent piece of earth, it obstructs the wet air masses coming in from the Pacific and can get hammered with snow in the winter months. Our estimates were for ~12 meters of snow to the previous summer’s surface or ~7.5 meters water equivalent! Compare this to Seattle where it rains about 1 meter per year. Combatant Col, where we are looking to drill an ice core, rests between Waddington and its neighbor to the north, Mt. Combatant. Enough ice accumulates in this mountain saddle to make it a flat and relatively safe space to camp away from the avalanches and mountain debris coming off both peaks.\n  Mt. Waddington summit and Combatant Col indicated by the arrow. Photo from summitpost.org.  My colleagues at the University of Washington, Peter Neff (now at University of Minnesota) and Eric Steig, started work at Mt. Waddington for Peter’s M.S. degree (Neff et al., 2012). They were successful in drilling a 141-meter core but were obstructed from drilling any deeper by substantial water within the firn, what has now come to be known as a ‘perennial firn aquifer’ based on similar features in Greenland. Despite not extending as far in time as they had hoped, the results from their ice core are novel and interesting. Layer thicknesses (for precipitation) and water isotopes (for temperature) are used for local and regional climate interpretation. They sample black carbon within the core which comes from summertime smoke associated with regional wildfires. One of the interesting aspects of a future ice core will be extending this wildfire record well into the pre-industrial. They found a drop in lead concentrations in the 1980’s which, while not as interesting from an atmospheric process understanding perspective, demonstrates how effective policymakers can be in altering the atmosphere. Leaded gasoline was forcibly phased out starting with the Clean Air Act in 1970 but followed by a series of regulations and an outright ban in 1996. The firn core at Combatant Col recorded the response beautifully. These are the types of examples that give me hope in an era of rampant climate despair. Another example would be the CFC regulations in the Montreal Protocol now acting to heal the ozone hole.\n  Data from the first ice core drilled in 2010 (Neff et al., 2012).  Our objective in this field season was to more carefully survey the col with geophysical tools in preparation for another (hopefully deeper) ice core to be drilled in summer 2023. We used two distinct radar systems for two separate purposes. First, we used a 10-MHz radar to survey the ice thickness, with the idea being that this relatively low frequency wave should be able to propagate through some water in the firn aquifer to create a reflection off the ice-bed interface. Second, we used a 100-MHz radar to survey the firn aquifer itself. We get a strong reflection off the water table, so it is quite easy to know where there is standing water and its relative depth below the snow surface. We do not get a good reflection from the bottom of the firn aquifer, so it is harder to know the total volume of water present or how deep the water can infiltrate before all available pore space is closed off as the firn transitions into solid ice.\n  Pulling the deep-sounding radar system on skis with the second summit of Mt. …","date":1661472000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661472000,"objectID":"a17a4aae4525028f7348a735c8cda865","permalink":"https://example.com/blog/waddington/","publishdate":"2022-08-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/waddington/","section":"blog","summary":"We typically think of ice cores in the context of global climate.

The surface topography, as revealed with recent satellite observations, is considerably more complex than previously recognized; the most prominent dome, which we term “West Hercules Dome”, is the most promising site for a deep ice core for the following reasons: (1) conformal radar reflectors (indicating minimal layer disturbance) extend to within tens of meters of the bed, (2) the bed is likely frozen, as evidenced by the shape of the measured vertical velocity profiles beneath the divide and modeling of ice temperature using three remotely-sensed estimates of geothermal flux, and (3) models of layer thinning have 130 ka ice at 50-90 m above the bed with an annual layer thickness of ~1 mm, satisfying the resolution and preservation needed for detailed analysis of the last interglacial period.

Ice is generally warmest at the glacier bed, being heated by the energy flux from the solid Earth, and coldest near the glacier surface where ice is in equilibrium with the mean air temperature. Heat moves between those two boundaries through the processes of diffusion (spreading out) and advection (transport by flow of the ice itself). Because the length scale for thermal diffusion in ice is long, deviations in ice temperature can be preserved for thousands of years.\n  Characteristic length scale of thermal diffusion in ice. Temperature variations can be persistent for hundreds of years in alpine glaciers and for thousands to even tens of thousands of years in the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets.  We measure ice temperature directly by drilling into it, installing in-situ instrumentation, and letting the hole freeze in on the instruments. The heat from drilling dissipates on the order of ~months and thereafter instruments measure the representative temperature. Ice-temperature measurements made at slow-moving, accumulation-dominated, ice divide locations (e.g. Greenland Ice Core Project, WAIS Divide) can be used to infer past air temperatures. The past climate is preserved within the ice because the frequency of those climate changes is within the time scale for thermal diffusion. We also measure temperature deviations within the faster moving ice-stream shear margins (more below) and the melt-dominated ablation zone. In the ablation zone, surface meltwater is plentifully available and transports latent heat when it penetrates into a crevasse or through a moulin to the ice-sheet bed.\n  Ice temperature deviations measured in a cube of Greenland ice.  In highly dynamic areas, heat is generated within the ice column through friction as the ice defoms. Warmer ice means a lower viscosity, more deformation, and thus more heat production, creating a positive feedback loop. Some studies even argue that much of the ice in an ice-stream shear margin is at the pressure-melting point. We found that this feedback is suppressed by cold ice moving through the system, ice that was source from higher and colder regions.\n   Whillans Ice Stream drainage area. Downstream gradients in the parameters that effect ice temperature.    Modeled ice temperatures using gradients like those above. \nRadar Attenuation Ice temperature can theoretically be measured remotely using radar attenuation. Attenuation is the result of energy absorption through electrical conduction which is temperature dependent. The function is in the form of an Arrhenius relation,\n  Empirical results for radar attenuation are generally dependent on the radar system and the empirical method used. Here, I show a result that we found in a single ground-based radar transect that traverses 200 km down the Kamb Ice Stream and up onto Siple Dome. We interpret the reflected power of the wave reflected off the ice-bed interface and calculate attenuation rate as the change in measured bed power with ice thickness. Essentially, if the wave travels through more ice we should measure a weaker return and the rate at which that measured power attenuates is temperature dependent.\n","date":1641772800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641772800,"objectID":"8307e698a131c7d71f7315397a554743","permalink":"https://example.com/project/ice-temperature/","publishdate":"2022-01-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ice-temperature/","section":"project","summary":"Heat transfer, ice viscosity, and radar attenuation.","tags":null,"title":"Ice Temperature","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"                   ","date":1641772800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641772800,"objectID":"178282d0f7a1ec8d0fef0983e2bbde07","permalink":"https://example.com/photo/greenland/","publishdate":"2022-01-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/photo/greenland/","section":"photo","summary":"                   ","tags":null,"title":"Western Greenland","type":"photo"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Snow crystals are deposited at random orientation on the glacier surface. In other words, the ‘crystal orientation fabric’ is initially isotropic (non-directional). As ice flows, crystal c-axes rotate away from the primary extensional axis and toward compression. In places where ice flow is consistent for hundreds or thousands of years, the bulk fabric becomes anisotropic. Single-pole fabrics with upward-pointing c-axes develop at an ice divide where flow is uniform vertical compression and outward extension (new snow continually added at the surface). In this case, the ice hardens in the vertical and preserves old ice near the bed. Horizontal girdle fabrics develop in an ice-stream shear margin where transverse shear dominates.\n    Deformation of ice is a result of primarily defect propagation along the crystal’s basal plane. This process is directional, defects do not propagate as easily in the direction of the crystal c-axis; therefore, ice viscosity is orientation dependent with the softest ice aligned with the basal plane. When a strong crystal fabric develops, the bulk ice viscosity can change by ~2 orders of magnitude. This can lead to a feedback where a consistent strain pattern leads to development of a crystal fabric which softens the ice and leads to additional strain.\nRadar Polarimetry The electrical properties of ice are also orientation dependent. Radio waves move faster (smaller permittivity, $\\epsilon$) when polarized perpendicular to the c-axis than parallel. This makes ice what we call a ‘birefringent’ material.\n  We can take this material property and use it in a technique to measure the ice fabric remotely (without sampling the ice directly) using radar polarimetry. Repeating radar acquisitions in the same location but with a rotated polarization leads to a measured phase shift associated with the varying wave speed. The fabric strength is directly related to the gradient in measured phase difference between the two polarizations.\nWe carried out a radar polarimetry experiment at Hercules Dome in order to constrain past and present ice flow there. The strength and orientation of inferred crystal orientation fabric tells us about the flow paterns in the recent past (~10-20 ka) which we compare to the present day ice dynamics that we can measure directly.\n","date":1641686400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641686400,"objectID":"7cb8d361f768705ee2a022dc502fd21b","permalink":"https://example.com/project/cof/","publishdate":"2022-01-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cof/","section":"project","summary":"Ice crystal anisotropy and radar polarimetry.","tags":null,"title":"Crystal Fabric","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I have growing interests in planetary ice.\nPingos and Permafrost   Martian Radar Sounding ","date":1641600000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641600000,"objectID":"f97fde9a41cebaad33366d6193abc490","permalink":"https://example.com/project/planetary/","publishdate":"2022-01-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/planetary/","section":"project","summary":"Extraterrestrial ice and analogs on Earth","tags":null,"title":"Planetary","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"ImpDAR ImpDAR (Impulse raDAR) is a suite of processing and interpretation tools for impulse radar sounding, led by Dr. David Lilien.

The core processing steps and general terminology come from a set of Matlab scripts developed at St. Olaf College under Dr. Robert Jacobel. Here, everything has been re-written in Python and significant improvements to speed, readability, documentation, and interface have been made across the board. Additionally, ImpDAR is intended to be more flexible than other available options. Support is gradually being added for a variety of file formats. Currently, GSSI, PulseEKKO, GPRMax, SEGY, and several custom file formats are supported. Available processing steps include various filtering operations, trivial modifications such as restacking, cropping, or reversing data, geolocation-related operations like interpolating to constant trace spacing, and various migration routines.\nIn addition to processing, ImpDAR can also be used for interpreting radargrams (i.e. picking layers). Picking is generally an interactive process, so there is a GUI for carrying out the semi-automated picking procedure. Each picked layer is saved with variables for both the depth and picked power (i.e. the root-mean-square amplitude). The GUI also allows for basic processing steps, with the updates happening to the plot in real time to aid the picking process. We are also developing an automated picking algorithm that will ideally pick both internal layers and the bed reflector.\n  ApDAR The ApRES (Autonomous phase-sensitive Radio Echo Sounder) is a new and popular tool within the glaciology community. It is a pulse-compression radar that transmits a phase-coherent waveform, so repeat acquisitions can be used for interference in order to measure small changes in returned phase. Phase changes are associated either with a difference in the total distance that the wave travels or differences in the wave speed through the medium. We are actively developing an ImpDAR extension for ApRES processing, called ‘ApDAR’. We preserve a similar data structure to the impulse data, so users will have some familiarity across the two.\n  Repeat ApRES acquisition, showing motion (phase offset) of measured reflectors.  ApDAR is built to be modular so that various ApRES acquisition techniques can be loaded and processed. One such technique is radar polarimetry, where the antennas are intentionally polarized in one direction or another to pick out differences in the material properties of the ice, namely the ice-crystal orientation fabric.\nSeiDarT SeiDarT (Seismic-Radar Toolbox) is a full-waveform geophysical modeling package meant for both seismic and radar applications (hosted on github). Again, the majority of the development is with ice in mind as the primary media, but the tool could be used for other materials as well. This package was primarily developed by Steven Bernsen and Christopher Gerbi at the University of Maine.\n  ","date":1641513600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641513600,"objectID":"f963b8208468c180e95b79c322f45fd0","permalink":"https://example.com/project/geophysical-tools/","publishdate":"2022-01-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/geophysical-tools/","section":"project","summary":"Instrument design and software for radar processing.","tags":null,"title":"Geophysical Tools","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Much of the original theory in glaciology came from work on alpine glaciers, mostly in Europe. This is partially because of their relative proximity to human civilizations, but also becuase until recently we thought that the polar ice sheets operated on millenial timescales, too long to be of immenent concern. It was only around the turn of the century that the glaciological community started to recognize key instabilities within the ice sheets that can be triggered much faster, on the order of decades to centuries. While alpine glaciers have since gotten less attention in terms of sea-level focused research publications and grant funding, they are still critical for water supply, temperature, and chemistry, especially in alpine environments.\nIce Dynamics We study alpine glacier dynamics using various tools and techniques. As an example, we use a ground-based radar interferometer at the north face of Mt. Baker. We repeatedly scan the mountain face every 2 minutes for several days and by comparing the phase return between scans can tell how objects in the field of view are moving. This is much like the ApRES measurement described in Geophysical Tools but many different reflections from across a range of azimuths.\n  In collaboration with Dr. Peter Neff of the University of Minnesota, we are surveying Combatant Col in preparation for an ice core to be drilled there in summer 2023. This is a radar survey which includes not only measurements of the ice geometry, but also repeat measurements to investigate a perennial firn aquifer and to understand how the ice is flowing.\n  Mass Balance The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has a surveying outpost at four alpine glaciers, Sperry Glacier in Montana, Wolverine and Gulkana Glaciers in Alaska, and South Cascade Glacier in Washington. For decades, they have been tracking the mass balance, the amount of ice added by snow and removed by melting. Understanding how these USGS ‘benchmark’ glaciers are changing over decadal timescales is helping us understand the regional influence of climate change. Our research group at UW works in collaboration with scientists at USGS, including Dr. Caitlyn Florentine and others, doing field campaigns to collect data for surveying these glaciers, especially at our local South Cascade Glacier.\nMeasuring glacier mass balance is relatively simple. For inputs, we drill a snow core or dig a snow pit at the end of the winter season and measure the total depth as well as density through the column. Together, depth and density give us an input balance in units of snow water equivalent (SWE). For outputs, we drill a metal stake into the ice at the beginning of summer and observe how much it has melted out by the end. Again, this measurement will be in SWE. Then the balance inputs (accumulation) and outputs (ablation) are summed to quantify glacier change. At South Cascade, the average mass balance over the past 50 years has been about -0.5 m/yr over the extent of the glacier’s area (Rasmussen and Conway, 2001; fig. 10).\n    \nThe conventional mass balance methods described above are still in use for many glaciers today, including a continuing record for South Cascade Glacier. Being glacier geophysicists though, we are interested in developing more innovative ways to measure the inputs and outputs for the system. In particular, we are using ice-penetrating radar to get a distributed snow depth measurement at the end of the winter season. The hope is not to abandon the snow coring completely, but to use the two in parallel to build a more robust, and glacier wide, observation for snow inputs to the glacier system. With radar, we can easily see a reflection of the previous summer’s surface (giving the total snow depth accumulated over the winter season), but in some areas we can also see deeper reflections from multi-year snow (firn) layers. Firn observations could provide insight into the mechanisms for accumulation in this alpine setting including avalanching and wind-blown snow.\n  ","date":1641427200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641427200,"objectID":"3b663cb16a8e97e57556460a2473183e","permalink":"https://example.com/project/alpine-glaciology/","publishdate":"2022-01-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/alpine-glaciology/","section":"project","summary":"Mountain glacier mass balance and glacier dynamics.","tags":null,"title":"Alpine Glaciology","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Ice-Core Drilling Much of our work aids in site selection for ice cores. We use geophysical tools to survey the ice geometry and stratigraphy. We can estimate ice age, ice temperature, past flow patterns, etc. With this information, paleoclimatologists are able to make an informed desicion on specifically where to drill an ice core in order to retrieve ice that will answer their pending quesitons about the ancient atmosphere and climate. Hercules Dome is currently our primary project. The site is close enough to West Antarctica that it should record a climate signal in the case of West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapse, but far enough that ice would not have melted during that time.\n  Hot-Water Drilling Unlike ice-core drilling, thermal drilling methods such as with hot water are destructive, so the goal is not to retrieve any ice. Instead, hot-water holes are used to install instruments which measure in-situ properties like ice temeprature, stress/strain, subglacial water pressure, etc.\n   Organizing instrumentation and cabling in preparation to deploy it down the hole.

I use an asterisk because it hasn’t really been the fourth at all. For the first season, in ‘18-’19, we had a 4-person team who was meant to deploy a full field camp for a full month of work on the ground; instead, we spent ~6 weeks at South Pole Station for a handful of day trips commuting back and forth to Hercules Dome. The second season was as expected, ‘19-’20 brought a 7-person team to the field where we did most of the surveying seen in the figure below. The third “season” was not a season at all, Covid halted nearly 100% of Antarctic field work in ‘20-’21. Finally, this current season that is wrapping up now was a small and lightweight team, with only a single scientist on the ground, meant to get in for only a few repeat acquisitions and nothing else. Hercules Dome was originally proposed as a 2-year surveying project and has now been extended to a total of 5 seasons, such is the nature of Antarctic fieldwork during a global pandemic.\n  A map of our ongoing survey at Hercules Dome overlaid on the REMA surface elevation.

Dots show locations where we measure vertical ice motion with a specialized radar system. Red circles show the priority for repeat measurements that happened this season.  I was supposed to be the UW scientist on the ground this season, but I failed the physical qualification examination (PQ) due to mild anxiety/depression. I am not particularly bitter about this. We were able to find a fantastic last-minute replacement, Erika Schreiber of Unavco, who successfully made all of our top priority measurements. Moreover, I was able to spend the holidays with my new fiancée and her family. Having said that, I do want to explain what happened and why I think it is problematic.\n  My fiancée, Dani, decorating the first Christmas tree we have had as our own after being together for ~9 years.  In July, I returned from Montana, where I had been riding out the pandemic, to Seattle in order to carry out my PQ. The necessary procedures include dental exams, blood work, as well as a range of other tests depending on the candidate’s age and history within the US Antarctic Program. As some examples, in preparation for my first Greenland deployment they made me get an EKG, and this year the doctor insisted that we do a prostate exam because the language on the document did not make it sufficiently clear that this is only necessary for middle-aged men. Like many others, I have a history of mild anxiety/depression for which I have been prescribed an SSRI in the past. This would not normally be an issue for Antarctic fieldwork, I have travelled to Antarctica carrying this medication before. I have even deployed without the medication at a time when I had elected to stop taking it, my doctor being unconcerned. This year was a bit different though. A flag came up during the mental health check on my PQ (who hasn’t been depressed during Covid??) and I learned that once the flag goes up it is very hard to bring it back down.\nEverything being in flux, I saw a new doctor for my PQ this season, one who had no context of my medical history. She was rightfully concerned about my mental health going into a solo field deployment, so she checked the box saying “participant will require further evaluation prior to clearance” since she wanted to start me back on the SSRI for a month before clearing me. Note that this was in July and I was due to deploy in November, so there was time for a secondary evaluation. I believe that my doctor saw me as fit to deploy assuming that I took well to the medication; unfortunately, the medical staff who carry out the PQ paperwork did not see it this way and disqualified me before my doctor could do any further evaluation. There is a procedure to waive the disqualification, but it involves my University signing off on a liability agreement which they were ultimately unwilling to do.\nI feel mostly unaffected by this disruption since we were able to find a replacement, and I was well supported by my academic advisor as well as my friends and family. However, this exposed me to inefficiencies within the PQ process which I feel could be more disruptive to others, especially younger students who have not had as many opportunities for fieldwork (note that this is a critical learning experience for many earth scientists). Mental health concerns are rampant among academics, and there should be a clear pathway toward successful participation in field campaigns for anyone who can safely do so. Moreover, the review procedure should rely more heavily on trained mental health professionals. My counselor said that she would be willing to sign off in approval of my deployment, but unfortunately her voice did not carry much weight in the process.\nAfter much back and forth, the decision was made clear …","date":1641254400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641254400,"objectID":"882a51be7bc4e84b96d32066736c9af5","permalink":"https://example.com/blog/remote-fieldwork/","publishdate":"2022-01-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/remote-fieldwork/","section":"blog","summary":"We are wrapping up our fourth* season at Hercules Dome, Antarctica.

Today’s mania does not reflect the more holistic vision and ubiquitous tokenization that is about to take hold. This includes physical assets like the deed to a house and the title to a car, capital assets like stocks and bonds, and as I will argue here, intellectual assets like patents and publications. Intellectual property as a digital object written to the blockchain will change the way we think about publishing science, opening the process to be more transparent and realigning incentives within academic communities.\nThe Past and Future of Scientific Publication What we think of today as ‘science’ formed around a culture of natural philosophy, where a small group of thinkers shared ideas through both spoken and written word. As time progressed and groups of thinkers got bigger, individuals wanted to benchmark ideas as their own. The first official patents were developed through the Venetian Patent Statute in 1474. Eventually, patenting inventions alone was not enough, thinkers wanted to document their understanding of the universe, and the first scientific journal was published in 1665 by the Royal Society. This exclusive group initially consisted of only 40 members. Finally, in the late 19th Century, many more subscription and/or for-profit journals began publishing scientific articles. Notably, Science and Nature magazines were both started at this time. While much of the science during this era was published as somewhat informal letters between authors, it is also when the peer-review process was formalized and publishing became what it is today.\nMany academics likely get the feeling of decentralization even now, especially with the myriad open science tools like Python, Github, etc.; unfortunately, the reality is that a few publishers control the space and that a few critical data centers hold most of the publicly accessible data. The majority of prominent journals still institute a paywall, publishing can be prohibitively expensive, and data products are often concealed well after the associated manuscript is published. Throughout history, unexpected events where the state seized control of information flow, like book burnings, have shown us that centralized powers can quickly and unilaterally manipulate free thought.\nAs a next logical step forward in the history of science and intellectual property, we can imagine publishing thoughts and inventions as NFTs on a dedicated Ethereum rollup. In this way, scientific information and the scientific process reach beyond a singular elite to become a public good. The landscape of blockchain-based science will include but strengthen all of the scientific platforms that we already use today. As open science builds upon the subscription journals that we have used for hundreds of years, so too will the future of blockchain publishing take advantage of the open science tools that we have been building in the last decade. The critical piece that will enable truly ‘open’ science is trustless ownership on the blockchain. Scientists will rest assured that a digital book burning is not possible.\nBlockchain-based publishing will be an improvement to the user experience as well. Any person will be able to benchmark their idea from any place and at any time. Since the blockchain cannot be edited, there will forever be evidence that the person had their idea at the time it was published. This takes power away from publishers, whose sole purpose is to act as an intermediary between the idea creators and the idea consumers. Then, with a less restrictive publication process, scientists will tend to publish more incremental progress and more continuously. Continuous publication will slow down the rush of publishing a written manuscript to avoid getting ‘scooped’, and it will give credibility in publishing investigations that do not result in a peer-reviewed manuscript or those that give an ambiguous result. Today, those efforts generally go uncredited. Instead, scientists will focus on incremental publications like software updates through git (which can currently be thought of as a private and centralized blockchain), data-sharing through a decentralized database (IPFS), and of course written articles through blockchain-based journals.\n  Academic Coordination through DAOs Academic communities will coordinate through Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). Members of a given DAO will share common interests, they will coordinate to progress understanding in their given field. As an example, I will use a community to which I personally belong, the American Geophysical Union (AGU).

Here, we use a cylindrical Stefan model to explore slush formation within the parameter space representative of hot-point drilling. We find that earlier injection timing creates an opportunity to avoid slush entirely by injecting sufficient antifreeze to dissolve the hole past the drilled radius.

Here, we develop a framework meant to guide the implementation of empirical attenuation methods based on survey design and regional glaciological conditions. We divide the methods into the three main groups: (1) those that infer attenuation from a single reflector across many traces; (2) those that infer attenuation from multiple reflectors within one trace; and (3) those that infer attenuation by contrasting the measured power from primary and secondary reflections. To assess our framework, we introduce a new ground-based radar survey from South Pole Lake, comparing selected empirical methods to the expected attenuation from a temperature- and chemistry-dependent Arrhenius model.

I would hope that it is always for the science, but I do understand how people get attached to the community down here. Life on the ice is mission oriented; whether for science or support, the team knows what needs to get done and works together to accomplish the task at hand.\nIf you read my writing last year, you will know that we had some logistical issues with our project at Hercules Dome. In a way, we had to come back to even get a real start. Having said that, it is common for field projects to be spread across multiple seasons, and some of our team will be coming down next year as well. I want to give somewhat of an explanation for why any field-based project would need more than one season on the ice.\nLogistical Reasons to Return The first and perhaps most obvious reason that we come back is that there is simply too much work to do in the short Antarctic summer. The only working months for deep field projects in Antarctica are late-November, December, and January. After accounting for some bad weather days, time on the front and back end to move cargo around and test equipment, and expected flight delays, there is not much time left to do the work.\nAt Hercules Dome, our original plan was to have two field seasons over which to spread the surveying that we had planned, the ’18-’19 and the ’19-’20 austral summers. For each, we planned ~20-30 dedicated science days with a small team of 6-7 personnel in an isolated field camp. Last year, a decision was made early in the season that the surface conditions were too rough at our field site to land the LC-130-Hercules (‘Herc’) which is the Air National Guard plane that we needed to bring in our cargo. Based on that decision, our contingency was to do day trips from South Pole Station using the Twin Otter (a much smaller aircraft). Our total number of science days at Hercules Dome last year amounted to ~2.5, so we obviously did not get done all of what we were hoping for. Fortunately, NSF agreed to fund us for an additional season (‘20-‘21) because of these logistical setbacks.\n  Our groomed skiway at Hercules Dome with the field camp on the right-hand side. Note the scale of the surface roughness, these sastrugi are what prevented us from landing the Herc last year. Photo credit: Rodney Fishbrook, our Twin Otter pilot for the first half of the season.  Even with our limited success, the radar data that we were able to collect last year were instrumental in starting to understand the dome and in our survey planning for this season. Coming into this season, we were able to place a 4-person ground crew in the field in late November to groom a skiway for the Herc to land on. The grooming equipment is a 500-lb frame with adjustable metal tines that plow the snow. We have been calling it a ‘glorified pneumatic rake’ which is dragged behind a snowmobile, essentially amounting to carving out a patch of the ice sheet with a lawn-mower . On December 22nd, the plane landed with ~13,000 pounds of cargo. Then, on December 26th the remaining crew (including myself) landed at Hercules Dome and our science could begin.\nScientific Reasons to Return Interestingly, our science also necessitates that we return to complete our measurements of ice motion. Ice moves slowly, especially at an ice divide or an ice dome like Hercules Dome, so we need to wait a considerable amount of time before we can return to measure how far it has moved. For horizontal motion, we use precision GPS instruments at the ice surface which give us a static location at one point in time. Leaving a surveying marker in the snow, we can return the following year to repeat the GPS measurement and learn how far it has moved in the horizontal direction. For vertical motion, we use a special phase-coherent radar instrument. This instrument is similar to our other ice-penetrating radar systems, but with a critical difference that it records phase information from the wave alongside the conventional measurement of wave amplitude through time.\n  A waveform represented in the complex plane.  Knowing why a phase measurement can be useful warrants another short physics lesson. There are three components to any wave, the frequency is how long it takes for a 2-pi period of the wave to pass, the amplitude is a measure of the real ‘strength’ of the signal, and the phase is the time-varying location of the wave within its periodic cycle. The animation above shows a waveform as represented in the complex plane. Looking at the circle, the phase of the waveform is represented by the angle that the rotating line makes with the horizontal; hence, the phase repeats itself every time the moving point completes the circle (i.e. at 2 pi). While the power (i.e. the radius of the circle) remains constant in time, the real component fluctuates.

South Cascade is one of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) benchmark glaciers, along with Gulkana and Wolverine in Alaska as well as Sperry in Glacier National Park, Montana. The benchmark glacier program was set up by the USGS to intensively monitor climate, glacier motion, glacier mass balance, glacier geometry, and stream runoff for these select glaciers which are thought to be representative of their respective region.\nWhy monitor glaciers? Aside from the fact that they are a fascinating aspect of the earth system, one reason is because they act as a low-pass filter on changes in climate. While climatic variables such as the air temperature and precipitation change on time scales as short as hours to days to years, ice flows slowly enough that it absorbs all the high-frequency information and responds at more like decadal (alpine glacier) or centennial (polar ice sheet) time scales. Therefore, glacier growth and decay are typically (c.f. tidewater glacier cycle) expressive of the longer term climate trend whether that be a change in temperature, precipitation, or both.\nAs a community, we have been measuring glacier change for at least several decades now. The easiest and most obvious way to do so is also the most illustrative for the public, a simple photo. Projects like the Extreme Ice Survey use photo time series to display glacier retreat in a way that needs no explanation. Some studies even use anecdotal evidence and drawings to extend the record further back in time (to 1602 for the Rhone Glacier). In our case at South Cascade, photos display that the terminus has retreated by ~3 kilometers over the past century. In the 1950’s and 60’s, this glacier terminated in a proglacial lake, but around 1970 the glacier pulled up out of the lake and now the terminus rests a full kilometer further uphill.\n  A photo time series of South Cascade Glacier. USGS.    South Cascade Glacier today. Note that this photo was taken in the spring, so there is considerably more snow (but less glacier ice) than above. Photo credit: Gemma O’Connor.  Mass Balance Methods While photos are illustrative, as scientists we want a more rigorous and quantitative way to measure glacier change. To do this, we calculate the ‘mass balance’ of the system, much like a water balance for those with experience in hydrology. The idea is what goes in must come out OR be stored in the glacier as ice. For a glacier, the balance input is snow, which through time is compressed into glacier ice, and the balance outputs are meltwater as well as iceberg calving. Hence, a negative mass balance means that there is more summer melting (and/or calving) than winter snow and the glacier therefore has a net loss (i.e. it is shrinking). On the other hand, a positive mass balance would mean net gains and glacier growth.\nAs shown in the schematic below, the high elevation areas of a glacier tend to have a positive mass balance because it snows more and melts less. This region is called the ‘accumulation area’. At lower elevations, melting dominates the system in the ‘ablation area’. The final component of glacier balance is ice flow from the net positive mass balance in the accumulation area to the net negative in the ablation area, keeping the system in a steady state if the glacier is stable.\n  A schematic of glacier mass balance. USGS.  Measuring glacier mass balance is relatively simple. For inputs, we drill a snow core or dig a snow pit at the end of the winter season and measure the total depth as well as density through the column. Together, depth and density give us an input balance in units of snow water equivalent (SWE). For outputs, we drill a metal stake into the ice at the beginning of summer and observe how quickly it has melted out by the end. Again, this measurement will be in SWE. Then the balance inputs (accumulation) and outputs (ablation) are summed to quantify glacier change. At South Cascade, the average mass balance over the past 50 years has been about -0.5 m/yr over the extent of the glacier’s area (Rasmussen and Conway, 2001; fig. 10).\n  Gemma O’Connor measuring snow densities and Erin Whorton taking notes.  The conventional mass balance methods described above are still in use for many glaciers today. Being glacier geophysicists though, we are interested in developing more innovative ways to get at the inputs and outputs for the system. In particular, we are using ice-penetrating radar to get a distributed snow depth measurement at the end of the winter season. The hope is not to abandon the snow coring completely, but to use the two in parallel to build a more robust, and glacier wide, observation for snow inputs to the glacier system. With radar, we can easily see a reflection of the previous summer’s surface (giving the total snow depth accumulated over the winter season), but in some areas we can also see deeper reflections from …","date":1559692800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559692800,"objectID":"53c6cbc66963459442762471f709d072","permalink":"https://example.com/blog/mass-balance/","publishdate":"2019-06-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/mass-balance/","section":"blog","summary":"Yesterday, I came home from a week-long field trip to South Cascade Glacier in Washington.

Ice flows downhill under the force of gravity. As it moves to lower elevation, it eventually either melts or calves and floats away, both contributing mass to the oceans. Thus, the principal importance of our research is to put constraints on future projections of sea-level rise.\nBeing a geophysics team, the research tools that we use are a suite of geophysical methods including GPS, remote sensing (satellites), ice-penetrating radar, seismics, and physics-based computer models. With GPS and remote sensing methods we measure the elevation and velocity of the ice surface. We get at least cm precision with our GPS (down to mm when using real-time kinematics from a stationary base station). With radar and seismics, on the other hand, we survey the internal structure and intrinsic properties of the ice sheets. The basics of radar (seismic) methods are to transmit a radio (seismic) wave at the ice surface and to look (listen) for the reflections. The radio waves that we transmit are in the high to very-high frequency range (close to the same frequencies that you would use in your car or on a handheld radio). Seismics in glaciological applications are typically active source, using an explosion triggered at the surface. By measuring the time and amplitude of the returning waves (both radar and seismic), we learn what we need to build intuition about the dynamic nature of the ice-sheet system. Finally, we test our intuition using computer models.\n  A cartoon illustration of ice-penetrating radar and some example data from the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream.  In this post, I want to focus on radar methods for a couple of reasons. First, they are the primary focus of my personal research. In fact, I have never been on a seismic campaign. Second, our current field season at Herc Dome is a radar campaign.\nInterestingly, the fact that radio waves penetrate ice was discovered not by a glaciologist, but by an atmospheric physicist. In the 1960’s, a man named Piggott had an ionosonde stationed on the Brunt Ice Shelf, looking for radio-wave reflections off of the ionosphere. Curious about the consistently absent signal at a regularly-spaced interval, he proposed that reflections from below (off of the ice-water interface at the bottom of the floating ice shelf) were interfering with his primary reflections from the ionosphere.\nOf course, we now know that Piggott was correct and have since developed theory as to why radio waves move so easily through crystalline ice. Most of the electromagnetic spectrum is absorbed by ice (making it opaque), although at different rates and by different mechanisms depending on frequency. High-energy photons (microwaves to visible light and higher) are absorbed and converted to either lattice vibrations (heat) or electronic transitions (electron jumps to a higher shell). Low-energy photons (~kHz radio waves) are absorbed by Debye Relaxation (molecular rotations). This leaves an absorption gap for the ~MHz frequency range that we use in our research. Therefore, radio waves at these frequencies can easily image ice that is 3-4 km thick.\nIn using ice-penetrating radar to image the ice sheets, by far the strongest reflection comes from the ice-bedrock interface. This interface represents a permittivity contrast (i.e. that the radio wave travels faster through ice than it does through bedrock). Here it is useful to recall an illustrative demonstration on wave reflections from freshman physics. Take two ropes of unequal weight and tie them together. When a wave traveling through the lighter rope hits the knot between the two, some of the energy propagates forward as a wave in the heavier rope (although at a slower speed); however, the remaining energy is reflected back into the lighter rope in the direction from which it came. The idea in our ice-penetrating radar case is the same, with the knot in the rope being analogous to the ice-bedrock interface.\nHaving ~50 years of experience behind us, we are building progressively better radar systems with which we can see not only the extremely bright bed reflector, but also the dimmer internal reflectors from within the ice column. Similarly to the bed, these are permittivity contrasts which are typically a result of variations in the impurity content of the ice. The visible stratigraphy of the ice mapped by these internal reflectors leads to the somewhat obvious geometric interpretations of radar data, but we are also starting to use the information in the amplitude of the measured waveform for additional insight. For example, if the ice-bedrock interface is melted the reflection is brighter, so we can use the strength of a bed reflection to say something about the nature of the bed.\n  The radar shelter containing the computer, a GPS on top, and the leading (red) as well as trailing …","date":1547510400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547510400,"objectID":"0a332a1fdaf8511d81bb9b6b086ef183","permalink":"https://example.com/blog/ice-penetrating-radar/","publishdate":"2019-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/ice-penetrating-radar/","section":"blog","summary":"We study ice dynamics; namely, how the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are moving, how they may have been moving in the past, and how they will move into the future.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Ice-Penetrating Radar","type":"blog"},{"authors":["Benjamin Hills"],"categories":["Fieldwork"],"content":"We made it to South Pole Station. It turns out that getting around this continent necessitates a bit of patience. We spent nearly a week in Christchurch, NZ, waiting for the weather to clear so that we could fly to McMurdo (the primary American station). During that week, we had two boomerang flights in which we took off and flew for ~5 hours down over the Southern Ocean only to get turned around back to New Zealand because the pilots did not feel comfortable landing on the McMurdo Ice Shelf. When the weather finally cleared, we landed in McMurdo and I was greeted by the rest of my science team who had been waiting there for three weeks.\nMcMurdo is an interesting place. In many ways it reminds me of Kangerlussuaq, the center for US science operations in Greenland. The town sits on the McMurdo Sound, across which are the Royal Society Range which tower to 13000’ from sea level. Being on the coast also means that there is marine wildlife. In the short time that I was there, we saw seals and emperor penguins, but when the icebreaker comes in and breaks the sea ice later in the summer whales, penguins, and seals will surely have a stronger presence. The culture in town in somewhat divided between the contractors and the scientists. They call us ‘beakers’, which, although somewhat condescending, is more endearing than the myriad nicknames I was given in high school.\n  Shuttle to our plane on the McMurdo Ice Shelf with Mt. Erebus in the background.  Finally, on Saturday the 22nd, we flew to the South Pole which will be our home for the next six weeks or so. Using the station as a home base was not our original plan. We had some logistical problems finding a C-130 landing site at Herc Dome meaning that we will be taking day trips in the smaller Twin Otter. Unfortunately, day trips will not be nearly as productive as staying out at Herc Dome for a full month, but the NSF has generously offered us an additional field season (now we will be coming down the next two years) because the logistical problems were out of our control.\nThe flight from McMurdo to Pole is over the Transantarctic Mountains. These mountains mark the boundary between East Antarctica, a stable craton, and West Antarctica, an active rift. We commonly consider the East and West Antarctic Ice Sheets as two seperate systems even though the ice is continuous between them. The East Antarctic Ice Sheet is high and cold; it is considered mostly stable. Ice flows down from East Antarctica through the mountains and into the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) which is lower and relatively warm. The bed of WAIS is below sea level which is the root of its susceptibility for collapse, something that has been very apparent for at least 40 years.\nThe beauty of the Transantarctic Mountains made it clear to me why ice-sheet landscapes are uniquely attractive. Natural beauty seems to fall into two classifications. The first is the most obvious, being dramatic landscapes such as the Alps or Patagonia. In those settings, sharp contrasts and strong lines highlight features that are striking to our eye. The second is more subtle. The rolling hills of Vermont or even the wide open plains of the Midwest are beautiful because diffusive processes smooth the landscape. These places inspire a feeling of quiet and comfort. Ice-sheet landscapes are unmatched in that they seamlessly coalesce both aspects of natural beauty. Ice flows and diffusively spreads into a smooth surface. Ice far from the mountains is completely flat and white. Only after adjusting one’s perception can the subtle surface slopes be noticed. On the other hand, in mountainous areas nunataks jut straight through the ice, with glacial erosion encouraging steep and dramatic profiles.\n  Flying over the Transantarctic Mountains.  Antarctica is stunning, but we are ultimately here for the science. The diversity of interesting science is what makes South Pole Station an exciting place. In the ‘dark sector’ there is the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, which is a 1 km3 network of Cherenkov detectors buried in the ice, and the South Pole Telescope, which measures cosmic microwaves with the objective of gaining insight about the origins of our universe. SuperDARN is a radio antenna, and a part of a worldwide network used to study the aurora. In the ‘clean-air sector’ there are automated weather stations, and UV measurements to study the ozone hole. There are also field projects based out of the station including our own, but also another University of Washington project on ice and firn dynamics upstream of the South Pole Ice Core (SPICE core).\n  Maintenance work on the South Pole Telescope.  The station feels as if it were designed by a science fiction writer. Perhaps science fiction ideas have been based on facilities such as this one.

This research trip came as a surprise to me because, in an emergency, an extra field personnel was needed. Two weeks ago, I was putting together a poster for the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in Washington D.C. and making Christmas plans with my girlfriend’s family. In the time since I was informed that I would be needed in Antarctica on Tuesday, November 27, I had to renew my passport, pass a rigorous physical examination (including full blood work, a tuberculosis test, a dental examination, etc.), purchase and pack gear for my first trip to the southern continent, write and print my science poster for a friend to hang up at the conference I would be missing, and finish my schoolwork for the quarter.\nMental preparation thrust me into a vortex of emotions. Obviously, I am both excited and nervous about the trip itself, but I also sporadically feel sad, isolated, exhausted, proud, hopeful, and even nostalgic as we pass through Christchurch, New Zealand, where I lived as a 20-year-old student. In the days and weeks to come I will have more trainings and preparations to do at both the McMurdo and South Pole stations. Although being dragged through this emotional landscape is somewhat inevitable, I am hoping for a mental shift toward sharpening my focus on our scientific objectives. After all, that is my reason for being here.\n  A map of ice core drilling sites in Antarctica with Herc Dome shown in red (borrowed from T.J. Fudge).  Our project at Herc Dome is tangent to my primary dissertation topic. I first learned about it when I started my PhD approximately 18 months ago because T.J. Fudge gave a talk at the 2017 West Antarctic Ice Sheet Workshop. T.J. and Eric Steig, another faculty in our department at the University of Washington, are interested in Herc Dome as the next drilling site for the US Ice Drilling Program. At the time of T.J.’s talk, this project had no secured funding line, but their ideas were maturing. I have since learned that ice core locations are intensely debated and that Herc Dome has been a highly endorsed candidate for over a decade.\nIce cores are useful for learning about past climate. Many have been drilled throughout both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, but each serves a separate purpose. The first few cores to be drilled, like those at Dome C and Lake Vostock, gave us a baseline for atmospheric isotopes up to 800 thousand years ago. Consistent oscillations in those data confirm the existence of past climate cycles and are strongly linked to oscillations in the Earth’s orbit called Milankovitch cycles. Some of the more recent ice cores, like the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide ice core, were drilled with the intention of obtaining high resolution information about the atmosphere in the most recent glacial/interglacial cycle (since the Eemian warm period ~120 thousand years ago). Learning how the ice sheets changed, and particularly the extent of collapse, during the Eemian would give us valuable information about what the future’s warming climate will have in store for polar ice. Unfortunately, no Eemian ice was found at WAIS Divide because that location is melting at its bed, something that wasn’t known for certain before drilling started. While the WAIS Divide core was a valuable contribution in that it produced the highest resolution isotope data to date, the record only extends to 68 thousand years ago and therefore provides no information about possible collapse of West Antarctica during the Eemian.\n  Paleoclimate data from three ice cores and an oceanic record used as a proxy for sea-level change (taken from a climate review paper)  Our ultimate objective for Herc Dome is to drill a new ice core which will hopefully extend through the Eemian and more rigorously address the nature of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet at that time. This site is at a critical location on an ice divide but between East and West Antarctica, which means that it will likely hold valuable information about flow between the two ice sheets especially in times of WAIS collapse. In preparation, this upcoming season is a pre-drilling geophysics campaign led by my advisor, Knut Christianson. We will use ice-penetrating radar to learn about the bed topography (among other things) and use that information to choose the exact location for the core, whether that be at the top of the dome or not. But how do we know what a ‘good’ ice-core location looks like from the radar data? We are looking for a place where the bottom of the ice sheet is cold (i.e. that it is not melting) because we want the old ice to be preserved. We also want a location where the internal reflectors are consistently flat so that we know the ice flow is relatively simple and has been consistent through time.\nOnly a handful of people have ever been to …","date":1544659200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544659200,"objectID":"854772473e622c109dcf50c4a8543152","permalink":"https://example.com/blog/going-south/","publishdate":"2018-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/going-south/","section":"blog","summary":"I am in the process of deploying to Hercules Dome, Antarctica (‘Herc Dome’, named after the airplane above) and will be in the field for at least a month, likely longer.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Going South","type":"blog"},{"authors":["Benjamin Hills","Joel Harper","Toby Meierbachtol","Jesse Johnson","Neil Humphrey","Patrick Wright"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538956800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538956800,"objectID":"c089e4b1d810112c62b560b0184665de","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/hills2018/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hills2018/","section":"publication","summary":"To assess the influence of various heat transfer processes on the thermal structure of near-surface ice in Greenland's ablation zone, we compare in situ measurements with thermal modeling experiments. A total of seven temperature strings were installed at three different field sites, each with between 17 and 32 sensors and extending up to 21 m below the ice surface. In one string, temperatures were measured every 30 min, and the record is continuous for more than 3 years. We use these measured ice temperatures to constrain our modeling experiments, focusing on four isolated processes and assessing the relative importance of each for the near-surface ice temperature: (1) the moving boundary of an ablating surface, (2) thermal insulation by snow, (3) radiative energy input, and (4) subsurface ice temperature gradients below the seasonally active near-surface layer. In addition to these four processes, transient heating events were observed in two of the temperature strings. Despite no observations of meltwater pathways to the subsurface, these heating events are likely the refreezing of liquid water below 5–10 m of cold ice. Together with subsurface refreezing, the five heat transfer mechanisms presented here account for measured differences of up to 3°C between the mean annual air temperature and the ice temperature at the depth where annual temperature variability is dissipated. Thus, in Greenland's ablation zone, the mean annual air temperature is not a reliable predictor of the near-surface ice temperature, as is commonly assumed.","tags":[],"title":"Processes influencing heat transfer in the near-surface ice of Greenland's ablation zone","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Hills"],"categories":["Educational"],"content":"Projections of sea-level rise from the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 5th Assessment Report are daunting to say the least. Policy makers are most concerned about the changes coming in the next century, over which we could see up to a full meter of sea-level rise. Even under the best-case scenario, dramatically curbing emissions today, the oceans will rise considerably by year 2100 (see the figure below). Looking beyond that 100-year mark though, the rates of sea-level rise become much more uncertain. The largest uncertainty in future sea-level projections is that associated with dynamic losses from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). Dynamic losses are those from speedup of the ice sheet, resulting in drawdown of interior ice and more calving into the ocean. Unlike ice melting, which pretty much scales linearly with the global air temperature, these dynamic losses could entirely eliminate an unstable ice sheet on the timescale of decades to centuries rather than millennia.\n  Historic and projected sea-level change from pre-industrial (1700). Future projections are for shown for the very high emission scenario (red) and the very low emission scenario (blue). IPCC AR5  The most simple way to think about the sea level in a non-steady condition is in the analogy with a large pool of water. When extra water is added to the pool, or if the water expands due to an increase in temperature, its average level will come up. This model of the mean, or ’eustatic,’ sea level is often termed the ‘bathtub model’ because it is like thinking of the global oceans as a bathtub and the added water as a turn of the faucet.\nWhile it is useful to conceptualize the bathtub model for preliminary calculations, in reality, sea-level rise does not come in this globally-averaged sense. A visualization from NASA shows that the sea-level change that we have recorded with satellites over the last 23 years is variable throughout the Earth’s oceans. The most obvious sources for the regional variations in this visualization include shifts in ocean currents or natural oscillations in climate. There are even localized human influences on regional sea level such as the rapid subsidence of a coastal city like New Orleans.\nThe above examples of regional sea-level rise are relatively complicated to fully understand or to project into the future. However, a more systematic sea-level adjustment comes with any change in mass of an ice sheet. Not only does a decrease in ice-sheet mass mean more water into the ocean, and thus a change in the eustatic sea level, but the mass of an ice sheet has a regional control on sea level as well. Each ice sheet having its own unique signature, these regional controls are termed sea-level ‘fingerprints.’ Sea-level fingerprints are the result of several physical processes acting together, and only recently they were directly measured for the first time using satellites. I briefly explain the physical processes of fingerprinting below.\nFirst, the Earth’s ice sheets are massive enough to attract the ocean toward them, much like the moon attracts the ocean to create tides. Therefore, if an ice sheet loses mass, the force with which it attracts the ocean toward it decreases and the local sea level falls nearby the ice sheet. If the ocean is to conserve water though (which it must), a local drop in sea level around the ice sheet means additional rise in sea level far away from the ice sheet. This idea of self-gravitation by the ice sheet mass is drawn out in the figure below.\n  Self-gravitation of an ice sheet. National Academies Press  Second, the earth under an ice sheet is not completely ‘solid’ in the sense that it would be unable to deform; on the contrary, the upper mantle flows viscously over long timescales, which permits the motion of tectonic plates. When a mass load (e.g. an ice sheet) is created on the surface of the Earth, the mantle viscously readjusts itself to that new state over the timescales of thousands of years. Likewise, when an ice sheet melts and disappears, the mantle fills in and the overlying crust subsequently rises up to its original elevation from before the presence of that mass load. This concept is called isostasy, and it is also important for relative sea-level rise. Today, previously glaciated regions such as the land around the Hudson Bay in Canada are still rising in elevation, or isostatically rebounding, by up to ~1 cm/yr as we come out of the last ice age.\nMost recently developed in the scientific literature is a third physical process, where alterations in ice masses near the poles can change the manner in which the Earth rotates. We know that the rotation of the earth creates a centrifugal force that pushes more water out at the equator than at the poles. In a similar manner, the rock mass of the Earth itself has an equatorial bulge. However, the axis of rotation and the corresponding equator are not necessarily fixed. If one of the ice sheets melts, the planet will …","date":1521504000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1521504000,"objectID":"c43b13b27913b551a71ef3349d7cc2e5","permalink":"https://example.com/blog/sea-level-fingerprinting/","publishdate":"2018-03-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/sea-level-fingerprinting/","section":"blog","summary":"Projections of sea-level rise from the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 5th Assessment Report are daunting to say the least.

Suppose water always froze as ice-one on Earth because it had never had a seed to teach it how to form ice-two, ice-three, ice-four…? And suppose,’ he rapped on his desk with his old hand again, ’that there were one form, which we will call ice-nine–a crystal as hard as this desk–with a melting point of, let us say, one-hundred degrees Fahrenheit, or, better still, a melting point of one-hundred-and-thirty degrees.\n This is an excerpt from Kurt Vonnegut Jr.’s novel, Cat’s Cradle, in which he presents ‘ice-nine’, a crystalline form of water ice with the potential to destroy the world as we know it. Vonnegut’s ice-nine, which I will call ice IX for consistency with the scientific naming convention, is stable at room temperature, and the crystalline structure will propagate from a seed. Hence, when liquid water is brought into contact with an ice IX crystal, it spontaneously freezes as long as it is below the melting point of this crystalline phase, 113ºC. The societal implications for such a crystal are boundless, for if it came into contact with the Earth’s water cycle the entire planet would freeze over.\nThe background for Vonnegut’s story is interesting. He was brought up in a scientific family, and a certain scientific style often shows through in his writing. The oldest brother, Bernard, was a physical chemist who, at the time, worked at General Electric (he actually helped Kurt get his first job at GE as well). For his work in atmospheric physics, Bernard was credited with discovering silver iodide cloud seeding, a technique that has widespread use today. Having a brother who studied ice nucleation interested Vonnegut in the phases of ice.\nAdditionally, this novel was published in 1963 which was a highly contentious time in the history of weapons research. There was an imminent fear of soviet attack, so much scientific research was directed toward our nuclear arsenal and other weapons. Bernard’s research on cloud seeding even had military applications. However, many scientists, including Bernard, had ethical issues with working toward such a goal. The ice IX story plays with these ideas, highlighting the danger of global weapons.\nWhile the ice IX of Cat’s Cradle is a fictional crystalline form, there truly are many distinct forms of water ice. In fact, one of the features that makes water unique is that it has nearly 20 crystalline phases that we know of, many more than most crystal-forming compounds. Most of these exist only in the laboratory, and all ice that we interact with on the Earth resides in one familiar crystalline phase called ice Ih.\nWater Molecule In order to discuss crystal structure for phases of ice, we must first review the properties of the water molecule. Water, H2O, is made up of two hydrogen and one oxygen atom. We know this from, among several other experiments, electrolysis where H2O is split up into its constituents of H2 and O2 gases. In the water molecule, the electronegative oxygen atom shares its electrons with the hydrogen atoms in strong covalent bonds.\n  The water molecule has two hydrogen and one oxygen atom. The angle between covalent bonds is about 104.5º and the distance from the oxygen nucleus to hydrogen is about 1 angstrom.  Importantly to the crystalline structure of ice, the electrons are not shared equally in the covalent bonds. The oxygen atoms hold on more closely to the electrons, which in turn creates an electric dipole for this molecule with the oxygen being the negative end and hydrogens positive. Because each molecule has its own dipole, there is some amount of electromagnetic attraction/repulsion between water molecules which ultimately controls many of the interesting properties that we commonly observe in the water substance. Most critically, the electromagnetic attraction between the negative oxygen and the positive hydrogen promotes hydrogen bonding between molecules. In a lattice, the hydrogen bonds determine the crystalline form of ice.\nIce Ih There are four hydrogen bonding sites for each water molecule, one at each of the hydrogen atoms, and two additional sites at the ’lone pairs’ of electrons which are located on the opposite side of the oxygen atom from the hydrogens. The four bonding sites promote a tetrahedral structure for stacking in ice crystals. Because of the angles between bonds in the tetrahedron, ice crystals form as a series of crinkled sheets each as a tessellation of open hexagons. We call these sheets the basal planes and they are stacked along the ‘c-axis’ which is orthogonal to the surface of the basal plane. In the ice crystal that we are familiar with, ice Ih, the sheets stack nicely on top of one another, alternating their crinkled pattern A-B-A-B.

While there, my research focused on heat transfer in Greenland’s ablation zone. I was fortunate in getting to experience this place, which up to now has been the most awe inspiring and the most intellectually fascinating place I have ever been. Spending approximately a month of time on the ice (over two separate summers) I learned how to work in such an environment, and specifically how to extract information from one of the most influential natural systems on our planet.\nIce Sheet Basics Ice forms on the Earth’s surface in places where more snow falls in the winter than melts in the summer. Typically, this means at either high elevation or high latitude, both of which are landscapes generally void of dense human populations. While it is easy for most of us to think of these as abstract places having no impact on our daily lives, as early as the 1960s scientists were warning of the potential for global influence by the Earth’s ice sheets.\nNow that we appreciate the scale for the importance of the Earth’s cryosphere, we are investing more time and energy into researching these environments. We are learning that the large ice systems are a sort of barometer for the climate system. When the climate is stable, the ice sheets will conserve mass, with equal flux in at the top to flux out at the bottom. The flux in comes from precipitation at high elevation and compaction of snow into ice. Eventually, that ice flows downhill and either the warm air temperatures melt the ice or it meets the ocean and ‘calves’, floating away as an iceberg (both melting and calving are outward fluxes).\nThis dichotomy of inward and outward fluxes is described in terms of accumulation of mass and ablation (melting). The conceptual model of an ice sheet (below) has an accumulation zone where more ice is formed from precipitation than is melted, and the ablation zone where more ice is lost to melting than is formed. Assessing this mass balance of an ice sheet has become a staple in the science of glaciology and provides a lot of information, not only about the health of an individual glacier or ice sheet, but about the global climate system.\n  In the accumulation zone, more ice accumulates from snowfall than melts. Alternatively, in the ablation zone, the entire winter snowpack as well as some amount of ice all melts during the summer.  The two ice sheets on this planet, Greenland and Antarctica, are unique in several ways. Importantly, these ice sheets are at different latitudes, the Antarctic being considerably further from the equator, and as a consequence much colder and larger. The Antarctic Ice Sheet contains approximately 30 million cubic meters (60 m sea level equivalent), while the Greenland Ice Sheet is only about one tenth of that. Because the Antarctic Ice Sheet is in a colder environment, it does not lose mass to melting, only to calving, and it therefore has no ablation zone. Greenland, on the other hand, has a rather large ablation zone, meaning that a significant portion of its mass loss can be attributed to surface melting.\nOur Project in the Ablation Zone   The location of our field area in southwest Greenland.  Greenland’s ablation zone is important because the ice sheet is rapidly losing ice from increased melting. Unfortunately, this area has not been intensely studied because only Greenland, and not Antarctica, has an ablation zone. Hence, we have a somewhat novice understanding of what makes the ablation zone unique, that being primarily the presence of liquid water. When ice melts at the surface, the meltwater flows downhill and forms a branching network of streams. Those streams eventually terminate in either a supraglacial lake, resting on the ice surface, or a moulin, which is a large shaft that brings water from the surface to the base of the ice sheet. Recent work in the ablation zone has shown that this meltwater influences the way in which ice flows, both through warming the ice and through lubricating the bed.\nThe science project that brought me to Greenland was focused on these alterations to flow in the ablation zone. Our primary objective was to drill hot-water boreholes into the ice sheet, in order to measure internal properties of the ice including temperature, shear strain, water pressure at the bed, etc. Using this data, we would partition the flow of the ice sheet into its two main constituents, viscous deformation and pure shear (sliding over the bedrock substrate). I should note that this project was already fully developed by the time I joined and never would happened without the hard work of many individuals at both the University of Montana and the University of Wyoming.\nA Primer on Hot-Water Drilling   Our research team getting the hot-water drill started on the morning of a drilling day.  There are two main approaches to drilling in ice.
