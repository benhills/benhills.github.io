Intellectual property as a digital object written to the blockchain will change the way we think about publishing science, opening the process to be more transparent and realigning incentives within academic communities.\nThe Past and Future of Scientific Publication What we think of today as ‘science’ formed around a culture of natural philosophy, where a small group of thinkers shared ideas through both spoken and written word. As time progressed and groups of thinkers got bigger, individuals wanted to benchmark ideas as their own. The first official patents were developed through the Venetian Patent Statute in 1474.

Intellectual property as a digital object written to the blockchain will change the way we think about publishing science, opening the process to be more transparent and realigning incentives within academic communities.\nThe Past and Future of Scientific Publication What we think of today as ‘science’ formed around a culture of natural philosophy, where a small group of thinkers shared ideas through both spoken and written word. As time progressed and groups of thinkers got bigger, individuals wanted to benchmark ideas as their own. The first official patents were developed through the Venetian Patent Statute in 1474. Eventually, patenting inventions alone was not enough, thinkers wanted to document their understanding of the universe, and the first scientific journal was published in 1665 by the Royal Society.

A total of seven temperature strings were installed at three different field sites, each with between 17 and 32 sensors and extending up to 21 m below the ice surface. In one string, temperatures were measured every 30 min, and the record is continuous for more than 3 years. We use these measured ice temperatures to constrain our modeling experiments, focusing on four isolated processes and assessing the relative importance of each for the near-surface ice temperature: (1) the moving boundary of an ablating surface, (2) thermal insulation by snow, (3) radiative energy input, and (4) subsurface ice temperature gradients below the seasonally active near-surface layer. In addition to these four processes, transient heating events were observed in two of the temperature strings. Despite no observations of meltwater pathways to the subsurface, these heating events are likely the refreezing of liquid water below 5–10 m of cold ice. Together with subsurface refreezing, the five heat transfer mechanisms presented here account for measured differences of up to 3 ∘C between the mean annual air temperature and the ice temperature at the depth where annual temperature variability is dissipated. Thus, in Greenland's ablation zone, the mean annual air temperature is not a reliable predictor of the near-surface ice temperature, as is commonly assumed.","tags":[],"title":"Processes influencing heat transfer in the near-surface ice of Greenland's ablation zone","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Hills","Joel Harper","Neil Humphrey","Toby Meierbachtol"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1507161600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1507161600,"objectID":"e001c96f5de1ce55878c27b517a20f11","permalink":"https:benhills.github.io/publication/hills2017/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hills2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Ice in the ablation zone of the Greenland ice sheet is known to contain vertical temperaturegradients that arise from conduction at the boundaries, the addition of strain and latent heat, andadvective heat transport. A three-dimensional array of temperature measurements in a grid of boreholesreveals horizontal ice temperature gradients that challenge the present conceptualization of heattransfer. We measure two distinct types of temperature variability in the horizontal direction, oneimpacting a confined region where ice temperatures span a range of 5°C, and another withtemperatures consistently varying by approximately 2°C across the entire 3-D block. We suggest thefirst demonstrates the localized and limited nature of latent heat input, and the second demonstratesthat vertical heat advection outpaces diffusion. Thesefindings imply that iceflow is highly variable oversub-ice-thickness length scales, which in turn generates contrasts in ice temperature that may impact icedeformation and fracturing.","tags":[],"title":"Measured Horizontal Temperature GradientsConstrain Heat Transfer Mechanismsin Greenland Ice","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
