<br>
I am interested in the physics of earth systems. 
In particular, my research has focused on the fluid dynamics and solid mechanics of ice as an earth material. 
I use ice-penetrating radar to survey the ice sheets, their geometry, flow, properties, and the associated implications for sea-level rise.
I believe in and try to practice open science, with free access to data, code, and manuscripts. 
#I also have interests in alternative publishing mechanisms, distributed computing, and proof-of-stake consensus.
